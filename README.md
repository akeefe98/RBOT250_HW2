# RBOT250_HW2
Homework 2 for RBOT 250

The assignment:

"Furthermore, given an axis of motion, w = [0, 0, 1] and a rotation angle of 45 degrees, write a python script that computes the exponential map of the rotation angle using Rodrigue's formula."

I used the formula referenced on this wiki page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigues%27_rotation_formula

The script hard codes the axis of motion and the rotation angle.
The script requires math and numpy.
